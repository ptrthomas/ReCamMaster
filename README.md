## ⚙️ Code: ReCamMaster + Wan2.1 (Inference & Training)
The model utilized in our paper is an internally developed T2V model, not [Wan2.1](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1). Due to company policy restrictions, we are unable to open-source the model used in the paper. Consequently, we migrated ReCamMaster to Wan2.1 to validate the effectiveness of our method. Due to differences in the underlying T2V model, you may not achieve the same results as demonstrated in the demo.
### Inference
Step 1: Set up the environment

[DiffSynth-Studio](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio) requires Rust and Cargo to compile extensions. You can install them using the following command:
```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf [https://sh.rustup.rs](https://sh.rustup.rs/) | sh
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

Install [DiffSynth-Studio](https://github.com/modelscope/DiffSynth-Studio):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/KwaiVGI/ReCamMaster.git
cd ReCamMaster
pip install -e .
```

Step 2: Download the pretrained checkpoints
1. Download the pre-trained Wan2.1 models

```shell
cd ReCamMaster
python download_wan2.1.py
```
2. Download the pre-trained ReCamMaster checkpoint

Please download from [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/KwaiVGI/ReCamMaster-Wan2.1/blob/main/step20000.ckpt) and place it in ```models/ReCamMaster/checkpoints```.

Step 3: Test the example videos
```shell
python inference_recammaster.py --cam_type 1
```

Step 4: Test your own videos

If you want to test your own videos, you need to prepare your test data following the structure of the ```example_test_data``` folder. This includes N mp4 videos, each with at least 81 frames, and a ```metadata.csv``` file that stores their paths and corresponding captions. You can refer to the [Prompt Extension section](https://github.com/Wan-Video/Wan2.1?tab=readme-ov-file#2-using-prompt-extension) in Wan2.1 for guidance on preparing video captions. 

```shell
python inference_recammaster.py --cam_type 1 --dataset_path path/to/your/data
```

We provide several preset camera types, as shown in the table below. Additionally, you can generate new trajectories for testing.

| cam_type       | Trajectory                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | Pan Right                   |
| 2 | Pan Left                    |
| 3 | Tilt Up                     |
| 4 | Tilt Down                   |
| 5 | Zoom In                     |
| 6 | Zoom Out                    |
| 7 | Translate Up (with rotation)   |
| 8 | Translate Down (with rotation) |
| 9 | Arc Left (with rotation)    |
| 10 | Arc Right (with rotation)   |

### Training

Step 1: Set up the environment

```shell
pip install lightning pandas websockets
```

Step 2: Prepare the training dataset

1. Download the [MultiCamVideo dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KwaiVGI/MultiCamVideo-Dataset).

2. Extract VAE features

```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7" python train_recammaster.py   --task data_process   --dataset_path path/to/the/MultiCamVideo/Dataset   --output_path ./models   --text_encoder_path "models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B/models_t5_umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.pth"   --vae_path "models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B/Wan2.1_VAE.pth"   --tiled   --num_frames 81   --height 480   --width 832 --dataloader_num_workers 2
```

3. Generate Captions for Each Video

You can use video caption tools like [LLaVA](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) to generate captions for each video and store them in the ```metadata.csv``` file.

Step 3: Training
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7" python train_recammaster.py   --task train  --dataset_path recam_train_data   --output_path ./models/train   --dit_path "models/Wan-AI/Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors"   --steps_per_epoch 8000   --max_epochs 100   --learning_rate 1e-4   --accumulate_grad_batches 1   --use_gradient_checkpointing  --dataloader_num_workers 4
```
We do not explore the optimal set of hyper-parameters and train with a batch size of 1 on each GPU. You may achieve better model performance by adjusting hyper-parameters such as the learning rate and increasing the batch size.

Step 4: Test the model

```shell
python inference_recammaster.py --cam_type 1 --ckpt_path path/to/the/checkpoint
```

## 📷 Dataset: MultiCamVideo Dataset
### 1. Dataset Introduction

**TL;DR:** The MultiCamVideo Dataset is a multi-camera synchronized video dataset rendered using Unreal Engine 5. It includes synchronized multi-camera videos and their corresponding camera trajectories. The MultiCamVideo Dataset can be valuable in fields such as camera-controlled video generation, synchronized video production, and 3D/4D reconstruction. If you are looking for synchronized videos captured with stationary cameras, please explore our [SynCamVideo Dataset](https://github.com/KwaiVGI/SynCamMaster).

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fa25bcf-1136-43be-8110-b527638874d4

The MultiCamVideo Dataset is a multi-camera synchronized video dataset rendered using Unreal Engine 5. It includes synchronized multi-camera videos and their corresponding camera trajectories.
It consists of 13.6K different dynamic scenes, each captured by 10 cameras, resulting in a total of 136K videos. Each dynamic scene is composed of four elements: {3D environment, character, animation, camera}. Specifically, we use animation to drive the character, 
and position the animated character within the 3D environment. Then, Time-synchronized cameras are set up to move along predefined trajectories to render the multi-camera video data.
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/107c9607-e99b-4493-b715-3e194fcb3933" alt="Example Image" width="70%">
</p>

**3D Environment:** We collect 37 high-quality 3D environments assets from [Fab](https://www.fab.com). To minimize the domain gap between rendered data and real-world videos, we primarily select visually realistic 3D scenes, while choosing a few stylized or surreal 3D scenes as a supplement. To ensure data diversity, the selected scenes cover a variety of indoor and outdoor settings, such as city streets, shopping malls, cafes, office rooms, and the countryside.

**Character:** We collect 66 different human 3D models as characters from [Fab](https://www.fab.com) and [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com).

**Animation:** We collect 93 different animations from [Fab](https://www.fab.com) and [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com), including common actions such as waving, dancing, and cheering. We use these animations to drive the collected characters and create diverse datasets through various combinations.

**Camera:** To ensure camera movements are diverse and closely resemble real-world distributions, we create a wide range of camera trajectories and parameters to cover various situations. To achieve this by designing rules to batch-generate random camera starting positions and movement trajectories:

1. Camera Starting Position.

We take the character's position as the center of a hemisphere with a radius of {3m, 5m, 7m, 10m} based on the size of the 3D scene and randomly sample within this range as the camera's starting point, ensuring the closest distance to the character is greater than 0.5m and the pitch angle is within 45 degrees.

2. Camera Trajectories.

- **Pan & Tilt**:  
  The camera rotation angles are randomly selected within the range, with pan angles ranging from 5 to 45 degrees and tilt angles ranging from 5 to 30 degrees, with directions randomly chosen left/right or up/down.

- **Basic Translation**:  
  The camera translates along the positive and negative directions of the xyz axes, with movement distances randomly selected within the range of $[\frac{1}{4}, 1] \times \text{distance2character}$.

- **Basic Arc Trajectory**:  
  The camera moves along an arc, with rotation angles randomly selected within the range of 15 to 75 degrees.

- **Random Trajectories**:  
  1-3 points are sampled in space, and the camera moves from the initial position through these points as the movement trajectory, with the total movement distance randomly selected within the range of $[\frac{1}{4}, 1] \times \text{distance2character}$. The polyline is smoothed to make the movement more natural.

- **Static Camera**:  
  The camera does not translate or rotate during shooting, maintaining a fixed position.

3. Camera Movement Speed.

To further enhance the diversity of trajectories, 50% of the training data uses constant-speed camera trajectories, while the other 50% uses variable-speed trajectories generated by nonlinear functions. Consider a camera trajectory with a total of $f$ frames, starting at location $L_{start}$ and ending at position $L_{end}$. The location at the $i$-th frame is given by:
```math
L_i = L_{start} + (L_{end} - L_{start}) \cdot \left( \frac{1 - \exp(-a \cdot i/f)}{1 - \exp(-a)} \right),
```
where $a$ is an adjustable parameter to control the trajectory speed. When $a > 0$, the trajectory starts fast and then slows down; when $a < 0$, the trajectory starts slow and then speeds up. The larger the absolute value of $a$, the more drastic the change.

4. Camera Parameters.

We chose four set of camera parameters: {focal=18mm, aperture=10}, {focal=24mm, aperture=5}, {focal=35mm, aperture=2.4} and {focal=50mm, aperture=2.4}.
